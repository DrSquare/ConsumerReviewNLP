## Automated Market Intelligence

#### This is Git Repo for Automated Market Intelligence (based on Amazon Consumer Reviews)
#### Team Members: Minha Hwang, Michael Trusov
#### Idea: Use prompt engineering and short-sentence transformer embedding to find (1) important product attributes (latent) and (2) consumer attribute-level sentiments for key brands/products

### 1. Dataset: <br>
(1) Standford SNAP - Amazon Consumer Review: Loaded in Git Repo <br>

Note that there has been sizable NLP research conducted before the application of LLM. However, those efforts were not scalable due to high-cost manual labeling tasks. <br>
